## BOM

*   4x heatset inserts (more may be required depending on your specific configuration)
*   4x M3x12 BHCS or SHCS
*   Fasteners from the spec toolhead

Notes:
For fastening the LGX lite, don't use longer screws than M3x12.

It's compatible with Hartk afterburner pcb, stealthburner pcb and no pcb. The standard cable cover fits as well. The different stock hotend options will also work.

If you're using the pcb adapters, make sure to check for shorts before powering on to be safe. You may need to trim the some pins on the backside of the pcb which may interfere with the mounting screws.
