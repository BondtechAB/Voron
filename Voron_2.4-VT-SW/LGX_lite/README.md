BOM will be depending on what modules you need and will assume you have the spec fasteners ready, so head on to the folders to find your version.

Thank you to ByThorsThunder for the work with the longer SB front and hotend mount: https://github.com/VoronDesign/VoronUsers/tree/master/printer_mods/bythorsthunder/Stealthburner_Rapido_Uhf
